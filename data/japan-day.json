            "Expressing his delight on the occasion, Mr Toshihiro Mizutani, Director General, JETRO Bengaluru, said, “Interest in India's engineering and scientific talent is growing among Japanese companies; as a result, we are welcoming double the number of Japanese companies as compared to last year's Japan Day. Since there is a critical lack of IT engineers in Japan, several businesses there are eager to employ motivated Indian expertise. The participating Japanese companies anticipate that IITH students will play key roles in emerging technological innovation and global strategies. Former “JAPAN DAY” has now expanded to “Japan Week” to showcase other aspects, including Japanese culture. We hope that the students explore a little about Japanese culture and also gain some essence of the Japanese corporate culture.” Read More...",
