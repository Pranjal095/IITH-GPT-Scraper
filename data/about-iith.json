            "Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) is a premier institute of science and technology established in 2008. IITH has been consistently ranked in the top 10 institutes in India for Engineering according to NIRF making it one of the most coveted schools for science and technology in the country.",
            "IITH offers undergraduate programs in all the classical engineering disciplines, applied sciences, design, as well as several modern interdisciplinary areas. Students are given a flexibility to explore a broad set of areas, and potentially pursue a minor or double major in a discipline that is not their own. Students who wish to seek a deeper understanding of their own discipline are strongly encouraged to get involved in cutting-edge research with the help of a faculty to mentor them, and earn an Honors in their own field.",
            "The very foundation of IIT Hyderabad is based on research and innovation. The vibrant research culture is evident from the number of patents and publications that IITH produces consistently every year. IITH offers graduate programs at both a masters, and a doctoral level, in several diverse areas. There are separate programs for technology, design, science, and liberal arts. The MTech program is offered in various modes and durations to cater to the ever-growing need of postgraduate level professionals in the country.",
            "IITH encourages and supports innovation and entrepreneurship at every stage. The minor program in entrepreneurship is open to all students of IITH, and many of the courses are offered by industrialists who are entrepreneurs themselves. There are various innovation centers and incubators that promote entrepreneurship and help mentor young innovators. IITH has been very successful in building tie-ups with leading academic institutions around the globe.",
            "IITH enjoys a very special relationship with Japanese universities and industries that goes beyond academic and research collaborations. In fact, some of the iconic buildings in IITH campus will carry the signature of Japanese architecture.",
            "IITH creates a unique holistic ecosystem for education that offers interactive learning, a very flexible academic structure, cutting-edge research, strong industry collaboration, and entrepreneurship. This is an environment which enables students and faculty to translate their dreams into realities.",

            "Dear Friends,",
            "Welcome to Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad.",
            "We are proud of preparing dynamic leaders, who make a difference to the world, with the skills that are nurtured here for a better tomorrow. As an institute that has completed only 11 years of its existence, it is gratifying to note that we are doing well and are almost on par with some of the first generation IITs. With the NIRF ranking of 8 among all the engineering institutes in the country and with QS Asia BRICS ranking of 94, we stand tall. This is essentially due to over 200 dynamic young faculty of the institute with an average age of 39, who work hard and take up challenges without the fear of failure, making IITH at the forefront of R&D innovations. A healthy faculty to student ratio of 1:14 and a good mix of UG and PG program with UG to PG to PhD ratio of 40:30:30, makes IITH a unique place for teaching and research.",
            "The strong research culture at IITH is reflected from around 500 sponsored research projects of Rs. 220 Crores that our faculty members have been handling currently. The number of Scopus indexed publications in the last 5 years are above 6000, which again reflects the thriving research activity. With a strong Japanese collaboration and the support from Ministry of Education, the second phase infrastructure development is in its full swing and is expected to be completed by 2022. This is expected to give a big push to the research activity of the institute. IITH has a strong start up culture with dedicated space for incubation and research park. By the end of second phase we will have about 1.2 lakh sft of space each for the above two activities, which will boost the entrepreneurship activity significantly.",
            "The fractal academics with interdisciplinary approach, with departments such as AI, Climate Change, Engineering sciences provide a unique academic atmosphere at IITH. The BTech program in AI, a minor in entrepreneurship, Executive MTech in Data Science together with the Design and Liberal Arts departments represent the unique and diversified academic fabric. MTech in E-Waste Management & Recycling (together with C-MET) and Energy are some of the new programs being planned from the next academic year, which will add value to the existing academic program.",
            "The campus life is improving on various fronts. The newly introduced mentoring of the students by faculty and alumni is expected to pump in positive energy into students’ lives. We have now a 24x7 hospital on the campus along with the support by specialist doctors visiting the campus regularly. The new supermarket, the 24x7 Nescafe and Amul outlet have made the life of the campus residents better.",
            "We are looking forward to strong collaborations, both academic and industrial, to help us grow stronger. Industry-R&D-Academia tie up on cutting edge technologies is the key for the growth of the country. IITH will play its part proactively in the near future in this direction.",
            "Wishing you all a very happy and prosperous new year,",

            "The design philosophy of the logo is based on the two key words ‘Inventions and Innovations’, the foundation and vision of IIT Hyderabad. It is depicted using two i’s with common dot above them. These letters emanates outwards on either directions signifying expansion and growth of that knowledge. This reflects the core values of the institute where it fosters and facilitates in expanding ones intellectual ability, creativity, research and scientifi c discoveries. The identity is a symbolic representation of a person reading a book. This indicates imparting knowledge through quality education. The logo has also been envisaged with another deeper and philosophical meaning. The circle in the logo depicts the sun, the primary source of energy. The portrayal of sun symbolizes guiding light, force, creation, growth and strength. The warm and radiating colour scheme is derived from the vibrant sunlight (which also reflects the geographical climate of the city).",
