            "Dear Friends,",
            "Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) welcomes you to the Dream Destination of Future Industry, Academic & Innovation leaders where each one enthusiastically endeavours our efforts towards our motto – Inventing & Innovating in Technology for Humanity (IITH).",
            "We are proud of preparing dynamic leaders who make a difference in the world with the skills that are nurtured here for a better tomorrow. We elegantly entered into our Crystal Year (15 years) and it is gratifying that we are doing almost on par with some of the first-generation IITs in many respects. With the NIRF ranking of 9 among all the engineering institutes and 14th overall rank in the country, and within the top 10 technical institutes from India in QS world rankings, we stand tall.",
            "This is essentially due to over 300+ dynamic young faculty of the institute in over 18 departments, with an average age of about 39, who work hard and take up challenges without the fear of failure, making IITH at the forefront of R&D innovations. A healthy faculty-to-student ratio of 1:14 and a good mix of UG and PG programs with a UG:PG:PhD ratio of 42:30:28 makes IITH a unique place for teaching and research.",
            "The strong research culture at IITH is reflected in 2,207 sponsored research projects of Rs. 877+ Crores that our faculty members have been handling. The number of Scopus-indexed publications in the last 5 years is close to 5,128, reflecting the thriving research activity. With a strong support to innovation, IITH has more than 190 patents and has incubated 125+ startups in the last 5 years, which have created 1000+ jobs and Rs. 800+ Cr revenue.",
            "IITH has a strong start-up culture with a dedicated space of about 1.5 lakh sqft for incubation and a research park, the department of Entreprenuership & Management and the School of Innovation & Entrepreneurship (being established by Cyient Foundation).",
            "With strong Japanese collaboration and support from the Ministry of Education, the second phase of infrastructure development is in full swing and is expected to be completed by July 2023. This is expected to give a big push to the institute's research activity.",
            "The fractal academics with an interdisciplinary approach, with departments such as AI, Climate Change, Engineering sciences, and interdisciplinary PhD, provide a unique academic atmosphere at IITH. The BTech program in AI, Biomedical Engineering, Biotechnology & Bioinformatics, Industrial Chemistry and Computational Engineering, IC Design & Technology (most of them being 1st introduced among the IIT system), a minor and double major in entrepreneurship, Executive MTech in Data Science, and the Design and Liberal Arts, Heritage Science & Technology departments represent the unique and diversified academic fabric of IITH. The institute has taken up several industryoriented measures this year. A semester-long internship in the 6th semester for BTech/BDes students and a mandatory 1-credit course on “Industry Lectures” are to name a few. At least 50% of MTech projects will be on industry-defined problems from now on. A number of new industry-oriented MTech programs such as Additive manufacturing (with DRDO support), E-waste resource engineering & management (jointly with C-MET, Hyderabad, and with the MEITY support), Medical device innovation (jointly with AIG, Hyderabad), Energy science & technology, Integrated sensor systems, Network & information security, Polymers & biosystems engineering and Smart mobility, will enhance our outreach to industry. We have also introduced Online MTech in Data Science, Microelectronics and VLSI, Communications and Signal Processing, Power Electronics and Power Systems, Heritage Science & Technology, Computational Mechanics, Industrial Metallurgy, Integrated Computational Materials Engineering and EV Technology, along with an Online MDes, so that working professionals can also boost their academics and perform well in their field of interest. In order to further support the working professionals, we have waived off the residential requirement for external PhD program.",
            "We look forward to strong academic and industrial collaborations to help us grow stronger. IndustryResearch-Academia ties upon cutting-edge technologies are the key to the country's growth. I am confident that IITH will play its part proactively in this direction.",
